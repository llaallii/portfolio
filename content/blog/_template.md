## Introduction

[Provide context and problem statement. What engineering challenge are you addressing?]

## Problem Statement

[Clearly articulate the technical problem, including:]
- Requirements or constraints
- Acceptance criteria
- Standards or regulatory context (if applicable)

## Approach / System Architecture

[Describe your technical approach with:]
- Architecture diagrams
- Key design decisions and trade-offs
- Technology stack

### Code Example (if applicable)

```python
# Include well-commented, reproducible code snippets
def your_function():
    """Clear docstring explaining purpose."""
    pass
```

## Methodology / Implementation

[Provide step-by-step technical details:]
- Measurement techniques
- Validation procedures
- Data collection approach

### Tables for Data

| Parameter | Specification | Measured | Status |
|-----------|--------------|----------|--------|
| Example   | 100 ± 5      | 102      | Pass   |

## Results and Analysis

[Present outcomes with:]
- Quantitative data (distributions, GR&R, accuracy)
- Figures with captions and units
- Statistical analysis where relevant

## Trade-offs and Failure Modes

[Discuss design decisions:]
- Why you chose approach A over B
- Known limitations
- Edge cases or failure modes
- Mitigation strategies

## Regulatory / Standards Implications

[If applicable, explain standards context:]
- Which standards apply (ISO 13485, ISO 14971, etc.)
- How your approach supports compliance
- Documentation requirements
- **Use descriptive language, not prescriptive guidance**

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
- [Bullet point format]

### What Could Improve
- [Be honest about challenges and iterative improvements]

## Conclusion

[Summarize key outcomes:]
- What was achieved
- Quantitative metrics (time saved, accuracy improved, etc.)
- Applicability to other contexts

## References

1. [Cite standards, papers, or technical resources]
2. ISO/IEC standards should be referenced descriptively
3. Include links to datasheets, GitHub repos, or tools

## Related Articles

- [Link to related internal posts]
- [Link to related project pages]
